# Othello_AIProject
A single-player Othello implementation with minimax algorithm.
This projcet has been impelemented in three phases.

* Phase 1
   * In this phase the logical parts of the game were implementd.
   * The gui of the project has also been designed.
   
* Phase 2
   * The goal of this phase was to implement an appropraite **minimax algorithm** in order to play with the user.
     in order to improve the algorithm's performance, we need to prune the minimax tree which can become really large. Therfore 
     we use **alpha-beta pruning algorthim**.
